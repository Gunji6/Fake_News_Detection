# Fake News Detection

## Overview
Fake News Detection is a web-based application that helps users determine whether a piece of news is real or fake. The system takes input as a news article, processes it using a trained machine learning model, and classifies it as real or fake.

This project is built using Python, Flask, HTML, TF-IDF Vectorization, and the Passive-Aggressive Classifier.

## Features
- News Classification: Users can input news content, and the model predicts if it's real or fake.
- Web Interface: Simple and user-friendly UI with a prediction page and a home page.
- Pre-trained Model: The model works on trained data and does not update dynamically.

This project provides a simple yet effective solution for identifying fake news. It can be further improved to adapt to real-world applications.
