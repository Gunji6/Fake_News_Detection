In this project, we propose a fake news detection framework that can address the safe and beneficial information from news articles and social contexts to detect fake news. Experimental results on realworld data show that our model can detect fake news with higher accuracy within a few minutes after it
propagates than the baselines. In this project we are going to use the dataset of news whixh is collected from kaggle to predict whether the given news is fake or real we use passive regressuve algorithm which is most efficient and easy to undertand.
